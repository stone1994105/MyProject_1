# MyProject_1
This is a tiny project for the computational physics course Fall 2018 at the Perimeter Institute. The goal of this project is to get familiar with Julia language features and practice them.

In this project, I investigate an example csv file that contains the bikeshare data of a city using "DataFrames.jl", and do some basic analysis.

Some useful references: https://juliadata.github.io/DataFrames.jl/stable/, https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/DataFrames.
